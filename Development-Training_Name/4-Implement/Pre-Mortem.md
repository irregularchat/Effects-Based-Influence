# Premortem Analysis

## Program of Instruction (POI): **NUMBER-POI_Title / Version 1.0**

## Date: **YYYYMMDD**

## Premortem Facilitator: [First Last, Email]

## Purpose
The purpose of this premortem analysis is to identify and address potential failures and risks before the course begins. By anticipating what could go wrong, we can develop strategies to mitigate these risks and ensure the success of the training program.

---

## Participants
[List all participants involved in the premortem analysis, including their names and roles.]

1. [Participant 1, Role]
2. [Participant 2, Role]
3. [Participant 3, Role]
4. [Participant 4, Role]

## Process
### Step 1: Imagining Failure
- Imagine that the training program has failed spectacularly. What are the reasons for this failure?
- Each participant independently writes down as many potential reasons for failure as possible.

### Step 2: Sharing and Grouping
- Participants share their reasons with the group.
- Group similar reasons together to identify common themes.

### Step 3: Prioritizing Risks
- Discuss and prioritize the identified risks based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurring.
- Use a voting system if necessary to determine the most critical risks.

### Step 4: Developing Mitigation Strategies
- For each high-priority risk, brainstorm and document potential mitigation strategies.
- Assign responsibility for implementing each mitigation strategy.
