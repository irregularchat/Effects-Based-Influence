### Instructional Guidance

**Conduct of Lesson** | **NOTE:** Before presenting this lesson, instructors must thoroughly prepare by studying this lesson and identifying reference material.
- Watch the robbery video until it bores you. This is important because, during the Concrete Experience, you should be observing the students.
- Before the lesson, set up one easel in each corner of the classroom. Place a marker set with each easel, and affix one scenario sheet (face down) to each easel.
- Before class, play the video completely through one time. This will reduce computer lag.

### Assessment Plan: 
%%If not covered in Section V (Student Evaluation), you may do a detailed write-up of the assessment procedures for the lesson in this appendix.  You can include or refer to Test Control SOPs, procedures for procuring and grading tests, or procedures for conducting performance assessments.  It is OK to include performance checklists here, but DO NOT include written test items or their answers in this appendix.%%

## APPENDIX C - Practical Exercises and Solutions

%%If the lesson has a stand-alone PE requiring coordination and detailed explanations, it can be written here. The write-up should include basic lesson plan elements, including the PE objective(s), resources, the time required, safety and risk information, and general procedures.%%

%%In TDCP, lessons using PE structure will have the PE included in this appendix.  If your lesson has a learning step/activity that uses PE as the method of instruction, do not use this appendix.%%
