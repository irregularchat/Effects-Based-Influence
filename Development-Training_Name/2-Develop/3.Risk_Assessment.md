# Initial Risk Assessment
*(ATP 5-19, 14 April 2014, paras 1-13 thru 1-46)*
Using the information gathered from the task analysis, the initial risk assessment identifies potential hazards and risks associated with the training tasks. This assessment helps in developing controls to mitigate or eliminate these risks.

### Instructions:
1. Enter all the risks or hazards associated with the TLO, ELO, and LSAs.
2. Determine the Severity and Probability of the hazard using the appropriate chart.
3. Using the dropdown menu, enter the Severity in the Severity Column.
4. Using the dropdown menu, enter the Probability in the Hazard Probability Column.
5. The Risk Category should populate with the risk category.
6. Enter controls for each hazard, and reassess.

### Legend:
- Severity: Indicates the impact of the hazard (e.g., Catastrophic, Critical, Marginal, Negligible).
- Hazard Probability: Indicates the likelihood of the hazard occurring (e.g., Frequent, Likely, Occasional, Seldom, Unlikely).
- Risk Category: The combined result of the Severity and Probability (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- Controls: Measures taken to mitigate or eliminate the hazard.
- Severity w/ Controls: The revised Severity after implementing controls.
- Probability w/ Controls: The revised Probability after implementing controls.
- Residual Risk: The remaining risk after controls have been applied.
