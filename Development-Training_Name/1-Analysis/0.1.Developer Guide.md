Appropriate Analysis of what the end result should look like, of the target audience, and of the tasks that need to be completed is crucial to the success of the training. The following is a guide to help you through the Analysis phase of the ADDIE process.

When analysis is complete it should be easy to prompt language models as needed or to pass to a team to begin development.

## Problem Statement

Write a problem statement to specify the performance gap. For example: "The problem isâ€¦ Military Intelligence Soldiers are not completing status reports to include all elements specified by the standard."

## Needs Analysis

### Perform a DOTMLPF Analysis on your problem statement:
- Determine whether or not each DOTMLPF domain applies to your problem statement. For each applicable domain:
  - Identify the current state of the domain as it pertains to your problem statement and
  - Propose actions that may alleviate the problem
- Answer the three questions on the DOTMLPF tab below the DOTMLPF analysis to prepare for goal analysis.

## Goal/Topic Analysis (as required)

Complete Goal Analysis based on the problem statement and needs analysis to write your SCOPE and OUTCOME statements. Complete a Topic Analysis to identify topical areas (i.e., Major/Minor Topics) to be covered by training arranged in a hierarchy.

## Task Analysis/TTI

Create a total task inventory (TTI) (5 tasks). Ensure task titles are written according to business rules, using action verbs aligned with the learning domain and level per TP 350-70-1 Appendix E.

## Difficulty Importance Frequency (DIF)

### Overview

Performing a Difficulty-Importance-Frequency (DIF) Model analysis on the tasks listed in the Total Task Inventory (TTI) is crucial to identify potential critical tasks. The DIF analysis will help in determining the training priority for each task, ensuring that the most critical tasks are adequately addressed in training programs.

### Difficulty (D)

Evaluate the complexity of the task:
- **Very Difficult (V)**: The task requires a high level of skill, extensive training, or significant mental/physical effort.
- **Moderately Difficult (M)**: The task requires a moderate level of skill or effort.
- **Not Difficult (N)**: The task requires minimal skill or effort.

### Importance (I)

Assess the importance of the task to the overall mission or job performance:
- **Yes (Y)**: The task is essential for successful job performance and mission accomplishment.
- **No (N)**: The task is not essential, but may still contribute to overall efficiency.

### Frequency (F)

Determine how often the task is performed:
- **Very Frequent (V)**: The task is performed on a daily or weekly basis.
- **Moderately Frequent (M)**: The task is performed on a monthly basis.
- **Infrequent (I)**: The task is performed a few times a year or less.

### Training Priority (TP)

Based on the combination of Difficulty, Importance, and Frequency, assign a training priority:
- **Train (T)**: Essential training required for successful task performance.
- **Over Train (OT)**: Additional training needed due to high difficulty or critical importance.
- **No Formal Training (NFT)**: Task does not require formal training.

### Task Analysis Based on DIF

- **Identifying Misinformation and Disinformation**: This task is very difficult, important, and moderately frequent. Therefore, it requires overtraining to ensure proficiency.
- **Countering Misinformation and Disinformation**: This task is not difficult but important and moderately frequent, so no formal training is required, but awareness should be maintained.
- **Identifying Rival Influence**: Similar to countering misinformation, it is not difficult but important and moderately frequent, requiring no formal training.
- **Mitigating Rival Influence**: Very difficult, important, but infrequent tasks should be overtrained to ensure readiness when needed.
- **Creating AI Generated Content**: Very difficult and important, though infrequent, necessitating overtraining.
- **Recognize AI Generated Content**: Similar to creating AI content, requiring overtraining due to its difficulty and importance.
- **Reporting Malign Influence**: Very difficult, important, and moderately frequent, thus requiring overtraining.
- **Additional Tasks**: Continue to evaluate and populate the table as necessary.


## Individual Task Analysis

Select the two tasks with the highest training priority from the DIF Model analysis and conduct an "Individual Task Analysis" on each, ensuring to include:
- Task Title (from TTI)
- Task Condition Statement
- Task Standard Statement
- Performance Steps (You must have a minimum of three performance steps but you need not 'complete' the task in three steps)
  - For Each Performance Step:
    - References
    - Supporting and Supported Individual Tasks (if applicable)
    - Environmental and Safety
    - Knowledge
    - Skills
    - Resources, Materials
    - Step Notes / Cues (if applicable)

## Skills and Knowledge (S&K) Matrix

For each of the two tasks you analyzed in the previous step, complete a Skill and Knowledge Matrix and answer the two questions below the S&K Matrix tables.

## Performance Measures

Complete the Performance Measures for the two tasks you completed in the Individual Task Analysis. Complete the three steps and any sub-steps needed. Answer the questions using the drop-down boxes. Select whether the step has sub-steps [Yes or No]. Select whether the performance measures are a "Product", "Process", or "Combination". Indicate where the performance measures are based on type of performance standard used by selecting either "Go", "No Go", or "N/A".

## Target Audience Analysis

Create a Target Audience Profile (TAP) Analysis for the trainees who will engage in the training. This should include all critical characteristics needed to perform each critical task, including any prerequisite skills.

## Gap and Resource Analysis

Perform a Gap and Resource Analysis to update the scope statement and identify resources required to deliver training. Additional instructions are provided on the sheet.

## Milestone Plan

The milestone plan identifies key review points (e.g., gate reviews) and deliverables within each phase of the ADDIE process, forming the basis of a project management plan. Milestones also comprise Synchronization Meetings, which are proponent meetings with all affected stakeholders to identify, align, and prioritize critical learning requirements supporting Army readiness. Examples of synchronization meetings include the critical task and site selection board (CTSSB), post-instructional conference (PIC), and course design review (CDR). All synchronization meetings will involve faculty and staff development and delivery activities that support the Army mission and Army learning intent for the purpose of refinement and prioritization of learning requirements (TP 350-70-14 (2018), Appendix C). It is IMPORTANT TO NOTE that the milestone plan is updated minimally at the end of each phase in the ADDIE process.

## TLO-ELO-LSAs

Write a TLO for your course; you can base the TLO on your task or an objective your task will support. For the TLO, include:
- Action Statement
- Condition Statement
- Standard Statement
- Two subordinate ELOs that each have:
  - An Action Statement
  - A Condition Statement
  - A Standard Statement
- Two subordinate LSAs for each ELO or four LSAs with no ELOs that each have:
  - An Action Statement

## Lesson Plan Matrix

Complete the Lesson Plan (LP) Matrix for your TLO and ELOs. You will develop ELO-A and ELO-B with only two LSAs each. For each LSA, indicate the:
- Content Type (Procedure; Concept; Fact; Process; or Principle)
- Cognitive Level (Bloom's Taxonomy of the Cognitive Domain)
- Method of Instruction (MOI)
- Time of Instruction (give an estimate for the number of hours/minutes instructing the LSA will require)
- ALA/GLOs (Described in the GLO White Paper)

## Lesson Plan Outline

The "Lesson Plan Outline" tab provides general guidance on completing the CAC-approved TDC formatted "Lesson Plan."

## Lesson Plan

This is the outline you will use for filling out the lesson plan. The directions are on the previous tab.

## Implementation Plan

Describe your implementation plan for your lesson.

## Post-Mortem

Identify Significant Potential Failures and Solutions.

## Formative Evaluation

Describe the formative evaluations you did as you went through the ADDIE process for your lesson.

## Summative Evaluation

Describe the summative evaluation tools you will use for your lesson.
