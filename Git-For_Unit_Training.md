# Enhancing Unit Training with Git and Markdown
By integrating Git for version control with Markdown for easy markup into unit training and technical exchanges, we can create a more efficient, transparent, and effective training. This approach not only enhances the development and delivery of training materials but also fosters a collaborative and responsive training environment which is essential for the modern operational force.

## Introduction
This document outlines the process, advantages, and recommendations for using Git and Markdown for developing, managing, and delivering unit training. By leveraging Git, a low-cost, open-source version control system, and Markdown, a lightweight markup language, we can significantly improve the efficiency, transparency, and effectiveness of unit training.

### Current Situation
TRADOC's centralized system for approval and distribution of training materials has left several gaps in the training process, including:
- Limited access to developed training resources by units.
- Limited interactions between instructors, students, and the operational force.
- Training materials often consist of slides rather than comprehensive lesson plans.
- Inconsistency in training environment setup.
- Frequent "false starts" with units recreating existing training materials.
- Lack of transparency and processes to push updates and take feedback.

### Current Problem
The use of slides exclusively instead of detailed lesson plans with slides has led to several issues:
- Difficulty in communicating and setting up training environments based solely on slide content.
- Challenges in transferring training content without extensive communication.
- Lack of transparency and processes for updating materials and receiving feedback.
- Limited ability to control versions and expand training content efficiently.

### The Solution: Git and Markdown
By using Git and Markdown, we can create a dynamic and interactive training library that addresses these problems:
- **Training Library using Git and Markdown**: Allows easy customization, rapid updates, and instant feedback.
- **Unit Training Knowledge Management**: Provides a platform for managing training materials without proprietary bottlenecks.
- **Rapid Updates and Ground Truth Updates**: Enables quick fixes and updates through pull requests.
- **Direct Feedback**: Facilitates direct feedback from unit trainers and students.

## Advantages of Markdown-Based Approach
### For Developers
1. **Ease of Use**: Markdown is simple to learn and use, allowing developers to focus on content rather than formatting.
2. **Version Control**: Git allows developers to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others efficiently.
3. **Transparency**: Changes are visible to all team members, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

### For Instructors
1. **Consistency**: Provides consistent lesson plans that can be easily shared and updated.
2. **Flexibility**: Instructors can customize the training materials to fit their specific needs without extensive rework.
3. **Ease of Setup**: Clear instructions and structured content make it easier to set up training environments.

### For Students
1. **Accessibility**: Students can access the most up-to-date training materials from anywhere.
2. **Engagement**: Interactive and well-structured materials enhance the learning experience.
3. **Feedback**: Students can provide feedback directly, helping to improve the training materials.

## Recommendations for Improvement
### Use a Git based Version Control System
For unclassified training materials for unit training, Sergeants Time Training (STT), and Non-Formal Training as well as Subject Matter Expert (SME) Exhanges use a git based version control system. Git based version control systems are free, open-source, and widely used in the software development industry. They provide a robust platform for managing training materials, tracking changes, and collaborating with team members.
These are available on the internet, to self-host, and on government networks.

1. **Expand Content**: Continuously develop and expand the training content available on the platform.
2. **Develop Non-Formal Training**: Create additional resources and training materials for unit instructors to use in non-formal training settings.

### Enhancing Git Usage
1. **Create a Fork for a New Course, or Exhcange**: Encourage developers and trainers to create branches for new lessons, facilitating better version control and collaboration.

2. **Utilize Issues for Feedback**: Use Git's issue tracking feature to collect and manage feedback from users.
3. **Incorporate Pull Requests**: Implement a process for reviewing and merging pull requests to ensure high-quality updates. You'll be able to provide permission to merge pull requests to the SMEs and the training developers. Others will be able to create pull requests, but not merge them.

### Utilizing Available Resources
1. **Learn Git Basics**: Ensure all team members understand the basics of Git.
